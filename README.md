# Diabetes  Prediction

## Objective

Original dataset    :  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes

Kaggle Competitions :  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

## Overview
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
